\title{The Attestation Maxims Formalism}

% Load the textual definitions of the maxims so their macros are
% available throughout the document.  `maxims.tex` defines the short
% natural-language versions of the maxims used below.

\begin{abstract}
  This short document collects the formalism behind the attestation
  design maxims and explains the classes of attacks the maxims are
  intended to prevent. The human-readable maxim statements are kept in
  `maxims.tex`; the technical formalism and examples appear below.

\section{Overview}

The following pages present the formal model we use for attestation
analysis and explain how each maxim maps to classes of attacks.
Macros providing the human-readable maxim text are defined by
`maxims.tex`, which is intentionally loaded before the document body so
that those macros may be referenced from the included fragments.

% Insert the main technical section describing attacks and how the
% maxims prevent them.  This file depends on macros from `maxims.tex`.
\input{attacks_prevented}

\section{Concluding Remarks}

The maxims are deliberately concise design principles. The formalism
above provides a minimal model for reasoning about when an attestation
is likely to detect an attack and when an attack falls into the
time-of-check-to-time-of-use window.  Future work may expand the
event semantics and provide automated proofs using the Coq development
contained in the `theories/` directory.
